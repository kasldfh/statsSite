If we ever get issues with snd round counts and events that come from excel, 
it's probably because of the way playerwise snd stats are calculated. Rounds
may or may not be the same number of rounds as a_score + b_score, because of
the way they are generated. If this happens, exclude the events sourced by 
excel from whatever the issue-creating page/stat is.
